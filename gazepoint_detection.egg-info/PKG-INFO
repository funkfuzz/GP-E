Description: # GP-E 
        ## GazePoint Estimation :eyes:
        
        The algorithm presented in this repo uses OpenCV, Dlib and a pre-trained CNN model called [GazeML](https://github.com/swook/GazeML) to succesfully estimate a person's point of gaze in 3D space. It does so by performing the following steps: 
        - Face Detection & Tracking 
        - Facial Landmarks Estimation 
        - Head Pose Estimation
        - Gaze Direction Estimation
        - Point of Gaze Estimation
        
        Currently, the algorithm does not perform any calibration to compensate for different person's orientation regarding the camera, however this is planned to be implemented.
        
        ## Features
        - Takes a single camera image as input (current default implementation works with Webcams)
        - Outputs head pose orientation, facial and eye landmarks, gaze direction vectors, point of gaze (relative to camera origin)
        - Visualizes of the outputs
            - The head orientation is displayed as cartesian coordinate system originating from the person's forehead
            - The facial and eye landmarks are displayed in orange 
            - The gaze direction vectors originate form the eyeball center and are coloured in cyan
            - The point of gaze is connected to the eyeball centers via a blue arrow
        
        ## Tech

        ## Install dependencies
        
        Run(with sudo appended if necessary),
        
        ```sh
         python3 setup.py install 
        ```   
        
        Tensorflow should be installed separately. Inside the setup.py there is a list of all packages installed installed in my current working virtual environment. From these you can create your own [Requirements Files](https://packaging.python.org/discussions/install-requires-vs-requirements/#requirements-files) if you would prefer.
